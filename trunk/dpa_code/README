usage: ./dpa <hypothesis> <path to data>

<hypothesis> consists of <power_model>:<keybyte>
	power_model is either hw for hamming width or hd for hamming distance
        use hamming width if unsure
	keybyte is the byte offset to guess (0..15)
	example: ./dpa hw:0 ./dpa_data/ to guess byte 0 using hamming width

<path to data> is the dir containing the 0000xxx.dat files along with aes.log

- results.txt contains the correlation curve for the key guess with the highest peak
  you can view it in gnuplot: plot "results.txt" with lines

- you can only attack one byte at a time
- to get all keybytes you run dpa 16 times with keybyte 0..15
